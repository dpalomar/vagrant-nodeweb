## <a name="3"></a> Installation and running

Just run `vagrant init dpalomar/nodeweb; vagrant up --provider virtualbox`

### Requirements

You need:

- Virtualbox ([http://www.virtualbox.org](http://www.virtualbox.org))
- Vagrant ([http://www.vagrantup.com](http://www.vagrantup.com))
- unix like shell (windows users look for [http://git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com))


## <a name="4"></a> How to start



1. Be sure that image is running
2. Run `vagrant ssh`

After that, **TMux** is started by default, then run next command to configure **vim**:

						vim +PluginInstall +qall

First time, vim shows up an error because no plugins have been downloaded yet. After this command the error disappears.

### How to build first web project

**NOTE:** You can build your project anywhere, so if you would use your own host system editor maybe you must create the project under `projects` directory.

There are two yeoman templates for generate projects with gulp, choose what you like:

- **gulp-angular**: allow to choose among Angular material, Bootstrap, JQuery.
- **webapp**: Use Bootstrap and JQuery

#### Example workflow

- mkdir projects/myApp
- projects/myApp (no _cd_ needed. Zsh style ;-) )
- `yo webapp`
- `git init`
- `gulp serve`
- lauch you favorite browser to `http://localhost:9000` _(if you use gulp-angular generator the port is 3000)_
- Split the window vertically to use vim editor with `ctrl+b %`
- In the new panel wtite `app/` to chage directory
- `vim home.html`
- press `i` to enter _INSERT MODE_ and write `html5` and press `TAB` twice.
- Boom! 
- press `ESC` key and `:w` to save changes
- browse to `http://localhost:9000/home.html` to see the changes.
- Modify the home.html file as you want.
- To save and quit vim press `ESC` key and `:wq`
- Press `ctrl+d` to exit from the right panel
- Press `ctrl+c` to stop _gulp serve_
- write `exit` to close session and return to your system.

## <a name="8"></a>Troubleshotting

### Vim reports errors after each run

- Maybe some plugins are not downloaded. Run `:PluginInstall` inside vim

### I can't see some symbols on my terminal

- You could need install some fonts, like powerline fonts.
- By default the image install some [Nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts "Nerd Fonts"). You could use this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/complete/Droid%20Sans%20Mono%20for%20Powerline%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.otf): 


### I feel the environment 'slowly'

- The image runs with 1cpu and 1Gb RAM
- It is possible to add more virtual memory and cpus. Check your `vagranfile` for instructions or browse through the [Vagrant docs](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/virtualbox/configuration.html "Vagrant docs")

### Running  `yo webapp` or `yo gulp-angular` inside `projects` folder ends with an error and gulp serve does not work fine.

1. If you are using a windows machine you need start `vagrant up` with administrator rights, because sym links.
2. Could be that not all libraries were downloaded. Run `npm install` and try again.

### <a name="warning"></a> Can I use CTRL+S to save a vim document?

* No, read below.

### After save a document in vim the terminal freezes

* Yep, If you use CTRL+S (as many editors use ) to save documents, you freeze the terminal. On Unix systems this occurs with this shorcut. Please use CTRL+Q to back the terminal to live.
